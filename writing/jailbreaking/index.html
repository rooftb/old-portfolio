    <strong>An Ode to Jailbreaking</strong></h4></center>
<p>
    Can you have a photo of the thief who just stole your iPhone e-mailed to
    you? Can you clean up your cache and temporary files to free up what
    precious little space you have on your iPhone? Can you even explore your
    local file system with simple Cut / Copy / Paste functions? No, I’m afraid
    with a stock iPhone, you cannot do any of these things. Everyone knows that
    Apple’s iPhone, while dominating the mobile market and generally deemed
    more aesthetically pleasing, is nowhere near as in-depth and intuitive as
    Google’s Android counterparts. But there is a side to the mobile operating
    system that Apple does not want you to know about— a side they tried to
    deem illegal and immoral until the Supreme Court ruled otherwise not too
    long ago.
</p>
<p>
    It’s called jailbreaking. The term is derived by breaking the device out of
    the Apple developers’ strict coding “jail” in order to run user made tweaks
    and software. This procedure has been around since around since the early
    days of the iOS, circa 2007. Developers started using this exploit to run
    applications that Apple deemed unsuitable for the App Store. Since then, it
    has evolved into allowing one to tweak certain system setting, apply custom
    themes, and even allow one to boot Android’s operating system on an
    iDevice.
</p>
<p>
    Personally, I can’t go a day without this one Jailbreak exclusive app
    called iFile. iFile allows one to browse the internal file system, with cut
    / copy / paste functions, which, might I add, was a major bummer to not
    have after making the switch from Android. Another essential is iCleaner,
    which I run about once a month to remove unnecessary temporary files and
    clogged caches, which in turn frees up nearly one gigabyte of precious
    internal storage. Activator is a fantastic tweak that allows any user to
    map out custom button and finger gesture processes. I have mine tuned to
    skip to the next song if I hold down the volume up button and to skip back
    if the volume down button is held. Undoubtedly, though, one of the most
    ingenious jailbreak tweaks is allowing a photo and location data to be sent
    to one’s e-mail of the thief who just incorrectly entered your phone’s four
    digit passcode. I’ve read a great deal of success stories of users that
    were able to give police crucial information on said perpetrators.
</p>
<p>
    But, don’t just take my word for it. I talked with a fellow who is no less
    than a genius on the subject and got his take. He is a software developer
    by the name of Eddie Noyes and he has jailbroken two iDevices in the past.
    I started off by asked him what got him into the jailbreaking scene, to
    which he replied, “In the beginning iOS didn't support multitasking, the
    interface also lacked an easy way to adjust certain features of the phone
    such as enabling Bluetooth or adjusting screen brightness without going
    into the phones settings. Today, you can swipe from the top of most any
    phone and have easy access to these features. iOS at the time didn't have
    them, so I turned to jailbreaking. I also wanted to tether my unlimited
    data plan and turn my phone into a wifi hotspot and jailbreaking allowed me
    to do that as well.”
</p>
<p>
    I went on to get his take on the legality of the issue and whether or not
    Apple had a point on attempting to outlaw it. Back in 2007, when
    jailbreaking the iOS platform came to be, Apple tried to rule a court order
    against the practice, which the Supreme Court upheld and deemed legal in
    2010. Mr. Noyes had quite a clever way of putting his stance on it, “Would
    you have a problem if your brand new car had an amazing sound system that
    would only play Justin Bieber? Or a microwave that you aren't allowed to
    heat chicken in? My favorite part Apple threw into the iTunes EULA is, ‘You
    also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited
    by United States law, including, without limitation, the development,
    design, manufacture or production of nuclear, missiles, or chemical or
    biological weapons.’” He continued with, “The iPhone is a tool, it can be
    used for good or evil. I think Apple would have a PR disaster if they
    disabled phones that had been jailbroken as there are too many privacy
    issues. I'll also add that jailbreaking must be pretty terrible for Apple
    to hire some of the jailbreak developers to their iOS dev team! Illegal
    just seems extreme, I think most normal companies just warn people that
    they risk voiding their warranty.”
</p>
<p>
    Eddie makes a good point, as with every iOS update there are always
    multiple features added to the official release that have already been made
    available on Cydia for a good while already. For instance, iOS 7 added an
    app multi-tasking feature that looked strikingly like a jailbreak tweak
    that had been available for years before. iOS 8 continued the trend by
    adding custom user made keyboards (for a fee, of course), of which there
    had been an multitude of via Cydia already. So it raises the question, who
    are the real innovators here? Apple’s highly paid developers or the
    independent ones who work for free?
</p>
<p>
    It is a bit striking to note that while the jailbreaking community has
    become relatively prominent, only about 1% of all iPhone users have
    actually utilized the exploit. A 2013 Forbes report noted that a
    ‘startlingly’ seven million have done so, but compare that to the five
    hundred million iPhones that have been sold worldwide and that figure
    hardly seems significant. Surely, there were more Jailbreak users out there
    than a year old Forbes report claimed, or so I thought. So I asked a man,
    by the name of Christian Turner, who runs a smartphone repair shop called
    StayMobile located in Charlotte, NC for his take on it. Mr. Turner is the
    Director of Training and Support there and said he sees his fair share of
    jailbroken devices. In fact he claims that one in every ten iPhone and
    Android phones brought in are Jailbroken or rooted, which I found a bit
    staggering. Though, he claims a fair more Android users come in with a
    rooted device than jailbroken iPhones.

<p>
    Rooting is in the same vein as jailbreaking, but a tad more in-depth. As
    Christian Turner described it, “Rooting an Android device gives a user
    complete root access to their Android OS, allowing the user to see and
    manipulate code, ROMs, hardware functions and much more. Since Android is
    open source and supports open development, rooting is very common with
    developers for things such as Applications and games.” This brings me to
    another point, if a developer really wanted open source coding on a phone,
    why even have an iPhone? Wouldn’t a rooted Android suffice for that niche
    market of nerds out there, hankering to run their own source code?
</p>
<p>
    Well, yes and no. After owning an Android phone for two years, I felt like
    a bad apple in a basket of well to-do ripe ones. Nearly nothing out there
    supports the Android OS. From car stereos, to MP3 boom boxes, to even a
    decent selection of phone cases, not a one of them has an incredulous
    amount of support for the Android user. We live in an iPod-compatible-only
    world I came to learn.
</p>
<p>
    I’ve outlined a fair bit of key points of the wonders of jailbreaking, but
    what about the bad? Sure, rampant piracy, that isn’t particularly
    wonderful. Stability is another aspect that hasn’t been completely debugged
    by the community yet. If one were to run two jailbroken scripts that
    clashed with each other, the iPhone, as has happened with me multiple
    times, locks up and goes into safe mode where you have to tediously get at
    what it is exactly that you installed that FUBAR’d your device. To be fair,
    it rarely happens, but when it does, you better sit down and tinker about
    for a bit.
</p>
<p>
    I got in touch with a programmer by the name of Chris Gill at Midlands Tech
    who has jailbroken two devices, an iPod Touch and an iPhone 4. He told me
    about his traumatic experience of attempting to install a custom Ford
    Mustang theme on his iPhone when, unfortunately, the device crashed and
    became stuck in a permanent bare Apple booting screen. Mr. Gill solved this
    by painstakingly reformatting the device via iTunes back to its factory
    settings. Although, this was back in a time when jailbreaking was
    incredibly unstable and didn’t have much of a safe mode, I asked if he
    would ever consider doing the procedure again. “No, not on primary device,
    or something you use every day,” he stated, “If something happens on that,
    it doesn’t matter.” Well put.

	</center>
<p>
    While some may not have the best of luck with the procedure, I compiled a
    list of features that those who had jailbroken claimed to be worth the
    price of admission. As Eddie Noyes stated, SBSettings, the dropdown menu
    that came years before the one implemented in iOS 7’s in 2013 and was
    nothing short of revolutionary back in the day. I asked a colleague of his,
    by the name of Lee Reams, what he utilized most. His response was a tweak
    that I wasn’t aware of called BiteSMS, which is an incredibly more in-depth
    alternative to Apple’s default Messaging application. One can store contact
    photos, queue messages to be sent at designated times and even password
    protect certain conversations from snooping strangers. Perhaps the best
    response to this question was when I asked a coworker of Mr. Turner’s at
    Stay Mobile the same thing, named Tim Atkinson. His go-to modification list
    included, “fine-tuned CPU and GPU control (overclocking mostly), Wi-Fi
    Tethering, modifying system files and removing system apps.” But even my
    previous Midlands Tech interviewee that didn’t have the best of luck with
    jailbreaking couldn’t deny that the incredible amount of system themes are
    astonishing.
</p>
<p>
    So is jailbreaking truly worth all the hassle and potential turmoil? Well
    it really depends on who you ask that. As I’ve learned from this research,
    no, most run of the mill consumers probably wouldn’t care for it. The risk
    of total system failure and the stained reputation of it is quite a
    turnoff. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though. One could make the
    argument that piracy would be at an astronomical level if every ordinary
    user out there were vying to jailbreak their iDevice. App sales would
    plummet and our Apple Lord Tim Cook would be less than pleased. But for
    those out there who want full and unrestricted access to a best-selling
    phone that is compatible with every other third party device on the market,
    then yes. Yes it is.
</p>
<p>
    But, is there a future for it? I will end with Eddie Noyes’s thoughts on
    the matter, “I think there will always be a group of people exploiting
    technology for good or worse. Maybe they want a feature that Apple won't
    approve in their App Store, maybe they're trying to do something illegal
    with their phone to install cracked apps. Maybe it won't be called
    jailbreaking in the future, but there will always be people who use their
    technology in unconventional ways.”
