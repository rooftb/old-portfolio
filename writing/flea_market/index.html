				<h4>How to Profit off the Flea Market<h4>
					<p>So you’re looking to flip a bargain, are you? Perhaps you’re interested in learning the art of haggling? Well, there’s no better place to do any of these things than at your local flea market. Flea markets are one of the few places left in society that allow one man to really no-holds-barred barter with another, just like in ancient times. Taxes and government regulations have no place here.
					Now you may be wondering where your local flea market may be. The website, Flea Market Finder (www.fleamarketfinder.org), is an excellent place to locate one near you. Having grown up a few miles away from a flea market, I learned all the tips and tricks from my father whilst accompanying him at 7 a.m on weekend mornings. That’s the thing with these places, the earlier you get there, the better. Peak flea market times are usually Saturday and Sunday mornings between 6 a.m. to 1 p.m.
					Things you will need: First and foremost, a good range of dollar bills is completely necessary. I recommend bringing a good bit of one dollar bills, a few fives and however many tens you see fit. You can’t exactly haggle someone down to ten dollars and then expect to pay them with a twenty dollar bill. It just isn’t right. But it usually is good to have a few twenty dollar bills hidden on you, so the sellers don’t think you’re too loaded. Most people are usually low on change, too, so it’s always good to be prepared.
					Another thing you may need is an iPhone with the eBay app installed. I’ve found this to be incredibly effective when I find something the catches my eye and I’m looking to flip it. Simply look up what past examples have sold for on eBay and compare that with what they’re asking. If it seems like a good deal, then by all means, take the plunge. Lastly, a pair of keen eyes is necessary to scan all tables as you peruse by.
					Step One: Finding the right thing. You can never go to a flea market expecting to find something in particular. It finds you. This step is perhaps a bit subjective as it all depends on what really catches your eye. My general rule of thumb is to find the most oddball thing a seller has. Often unusual looking antique knick-knacks are an easy flip, as not too many sellers know their true worth. From flipping a miniature Abe Lincoln statue to a Paul McCartney figurine, my father showed me the light on the value of knick-knacks. But honestly, the easiest deals are always records. People are always trying to get rid of their collections for cheap and price them all the same. One can usually find a few gems for not a whole lot in these assortments.
					Step Two: Haggling. Haggling is like learning to ride a bike. Sure, you may mess up at first or you may have a few sellers scoff at you and say you’re crazy. But once you get over these hurdles, there is nothing to it. I learned how to do it from my father and I hope to pass the art down to my kids one day. I will do my best to explain here.
					First of all, intimidation is key. I’ve found wearing sunglasses, particularly aviators, to be quite effective here. Having a bit of small talk with the seller is good to soften them up at first. Ask them how their morning has been or what all they have sold so far. This will give you a good idea how desperate they are to get rid of their inventory as well as establish a buyer-seller bond. But when you’re about to go in for the kill, don’t smile or use any funny business. Think of it like playing poker.
					Right, now that you’ve told the seller you’re interested in something, I’ve found that starting off by offering them ¼ of their asking price to be most effective as it leaves a lot of leeway. If they ask twenty, you say five. Now depending on the seller’s mood he may tell you just to go away right then and there. Most of the time, though, they’ll give you a simple “I can’t go for that,” and so you’ve got to counter offer. Typically, making a rebuttal around half (give or take) of their asking price seems to go a long way. A lot of times this works, but sometimes it doesn’t.
					If they still decline you, then you must make an internal debate about if the item at hand is really worth it. Now it’s time to pull out the trusty “Can I meet you in the middle?” catchphrase. Offer the seller then up to ¾ of their asking price and usually, they will abide. If they aren’t budging, though, then it’s really up to you. Sometimes, though, if the item at hand’s asking price is incredibly lower than what it goes for on eBay, then I’ll just give it to them right then and there so as not to feel like I stole said item from a seller. It helps me sleep at night.
					Step Three: Flipping. There’s really nothing to it, but it is very easy to screw up. It all depends on how you want to go about this. Personally, eBay is my go-to method, but there are plenty of other ways. I suppose one could just go open a flea market table of their own to sell what they’ve bought at a higher price. But, that’s just cold blooded. For this step, though, I’ll be talking about online eBay auctions.
					The first thing you want are some good pictures. I mean, top notch high resolution photos of the item you’re selling. Zoom in on particular carvings and texts that may be inscribed on a product. Take photos from the front, back and all sides. My father’s rule of thumb here has been to always have no less than five photos per listing, but it’s really up to your discretion.
					Without a doubt, though, the most important thing to have is a thorough description of the product. Nobody wants bad feedback for not accurately describing a product. If said product doesn’t function as it used to, always list it as “AS-IS.” Test the product out and make sure it does what it’s supposed to do if it has moving parts. Learn from my mistake, as I once sold a vintage ice cream maker without plugging it in to test and the elderly couple that received it filed a page long claim as to how it didn’t function properly and why they demanded a refund. It’s wasn’t my brightest moment.
					Shipping is always a major factor here. Make sure you have the appropriate box to send the item in and always use newspaper to fill it up so as not to make the item move around much during transport. A good rule of thumb here is to never set a fixed shipping price as I’ve had potential buyers message me asking if I could lower the shipping price. It can make or break a sale. eBay introduced an automatic shipping calculator not too long ago, though, so this process really isn’t too difficult anymore.
					Finally, once the buyer has received the product and you’ve made your profit, always be sure to leave good feedback. Feedback makes the eBay marketplace work like a well oiled machine. With all of that completed, you’ve (hopefully) successfully profited from the flea market. Wasn’t that just swell? Flipping really is a great practice when you’re just trying to make a few dollars on the side and can eventually really add up.</p>
